  # Youth Mental Health Trends & Intervention Outcomes

## Overview
This project explores trends in youth mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, wellbeing) and evaluates the impact of interventions using a simulated UK dataset.

## Research Questions
- How have youth anxiety, depression, and wellbeing changed over time?
- Do interventions improve mental health outcomes?
- Are intervention effects different by age and gender?

## Methods
- Data analysis using Excel and Python
- Descriptive statistics and group comparisons
- Visualisation of trends and intervention outcomes

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Dashboards)

## Key Findings
- Anxiety and depression increased over time while wellbeing declined
- Young people receiving interventions showed better mental health outcomes
- Stronger intervention effects were observed among younger adolescents

## Relevance
This project demonstrates applied data analysis skills in a psychological and public health context, with relevance to early intervention services, CAMHS, and community-based mental health support.
